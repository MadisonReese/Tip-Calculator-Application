# Pre-work - Tip Calculator Application

Tip Calculator Application is a tip calculator application for iOS

Submitted by: Madison Reese

Time spent: (estimated) 20 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [ ] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [ ] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly. (In this application I used a slider instead.)

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] User can selected between number of people to split the total bill after gratuity with on the segmented control. 
- [ ] Slider for the tip control displays the percentage of the slider through a label. 
- [ ] A settings view controller can be opened, however, there are no functions implemented in the controller (In Progress).

## Notes

During the process of building this application, I was experimenting on changing background colors when certain uiviews were tapped by the user. I managed to change the color, then could not figure out how to have the color change back when unselected. I was also working on moving the split control to the settings view controller, however, it would ruin the 'value changes' I had set to calculate the total label on the main view controller. Given more time and research I will be able to implement these changes. However, I found that my beginner attempts made my application appear unclean and created a chain of bugs.

Overall, through expirimenting with the many functions of XCode, I became familiarized with Swift and how to use XCode effectively. Previously, I have mostly coded algorithmic java programs which remain in the terminal, so it was intriguing to see how programming can be used to visually create mobile applications.
